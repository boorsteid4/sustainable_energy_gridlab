# Sustainable Energy with GridLAB-D and Excel

## Introduction
We are combining the utility of Microsoft Excel and the power of GridLAB-D to rapidly import power feeder information into console-based code for GridLAB-D. This will allow us to easily and expediently use data from preexisting power flow systems and calculate voltage drops, loads, and much more. It will give us the ability to optimize power flow systems for new energy sources, such as PV and wind.
